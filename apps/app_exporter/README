The App Exporter provides an easy-to-use interface for exporting Splunk Apps from within the Splunk UI. Maintains your preferred list of to-be-exported apps - great for moving your bunch of freshly developed apps from your development Splunk environment to testing environments and beyond!

Exporting apps using the App Exporter requires just two simple steps - select apps to export first, then hit the export button. Done.

Your selection is stored to let you export the same list of apps when you've fixed those bugs or built that new feature, ready to move them all on to the next environment - or to upload them on apps.splunk.com!
Once exported, you can either pluck the .spl files from your Splunk server's file system, or download them through the management port.
